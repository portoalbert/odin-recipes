        <h4>

            <p> Shrimp are so delicious. I make them often for my family, and I have many ways of prepping them,
                 including shrimp scampi, baked shrimp, and broiled shrimp.
            </p>
            <p> Grilling shrimp is one of the easiest and fastest ways of making them. And I love that you don't need to marinate the shrimp before cooking. Simply coat them in olive oil and spices, thread them on skewers, and grill. Shrimp are small,
                 so they're ready fast, making them the ideal dish to make for a weeknight dinner.</p>

        <h4> Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil: I love this oil and use it frequently when I cook. It does have a low smoke point, so you can certainly use avocado oil instead.</li>
            <li>To season: I like to use Kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. I prefer garlic powder to fresh minced garlic in this recipe because it more uniformly coats the shrimp and it doesn't burn as easily.</li>
            <li>Raw shrimp: I use large peeled and deveined shrimp in this recipe. I wouldn't use small ones for grilling. Extra-large will work too, although they might need to stay slightly longer on the grill.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You start by whisking together the olive oil, lemon juice, Kosher salt, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. You'll get a nice, spicy sauce.</li>
            <li>Now, add the shrimp to the sauce and toss to coat, then thread them on skewers.</li>
            <li>Grill until opaque and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side over medium-high heat.</li>
        </ol>
