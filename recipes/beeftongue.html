        <h4>

            <p> Nose-to-tail eating is the responsible way for meat-eaters to consume meat.
                 And this particular cut makes it very palatable indeed. 
                 It's wonderfully flavorful and tender, and it's also surprisingly 
                 easy to make.
            </p>
            <p> I learned to cook lengua from my friend Irina, a wonderful cook who makes 
                many traditional recipes. My entire family loves it - yes, even the kids!</p>
        </h4>
        <h4> Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef tongue: Not readily available in U.S.
                 supermarkets, I often special-order it at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Spices: I use dried bay leaves, whole peppercorns, and whole allspice.</li>
            <li> Butter: I love using creamy European butter, but any butter will be great. </li>
            <li> Onions and mushrooms: As a lazy cook, I often use the food processor to cho
                p onions, and I buy pre-sliced mushrooms. </li>
            <li> Beef broth: Store-bought is fine - just check the ingredien
                ts list to make sure it looks OK. </li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper: If using fine salt, you should reduce the amount you use,
                 or the dish could end up too salty.</li>   
            <li>Cornstarch: Just 1 teaspoon to thicken the sauce.</li>   
        </ul>
        <h4> Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You start by simmering the tongue with spices until tender, 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Allow it to slightly cool, just until it's easier to handle, then remove the skin and slice it.</li>
            <li>If making the sauce, cook the onions and mushrooms in butter, then add beef broth,
                 kosher salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced meat to this tasty sauce and simmer it for 30 minutes, until it's super tender.
                 You can thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch if you'd like.</li>
            <li>To serve, arrange slices on plates and top them with the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
